# zeta-music-visualizer
This site calculates the first n non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, saves them to a text file, and simultaneously converts them into a MIDI file. Each zero is mapped to a MIDI note, with its imaginary part determining the pitch and a fixed duration for simplicity.
